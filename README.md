# Mailkick

:bullettrain_side: Email subscriptions made easy

- Add one-click unsubscribe links to your emails
- Fetch bounces and spam reports from your email service

Gracefully handles email address changes

## Installation

Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mailkick'
```

Add these lines to your routes.rb file:
```
mount Mailkick::Engine => "/mailkick"

  Mailkick::Engine.routes.draw do
    resources :subscriptions, only: [:show] do
      get :unsubscribe, on: :member
      get :subscribe, on: :member
    end
  end
```

And run the generator. This creates a model to store opt-outs.

```sh
rails generate mailkick:install
rake db:migrate
```

## How It Works

Add an unsubscribe link to your emails.

#### Text

```erb
Unsubscribe: <%= mailkick_unsubscribe_url %>
```

#### HTML

```erb
<%= link_to "Unsubscribe", mailkick_unsubscribe_url %>
```

When a user unsubscribes, he or she is taken to a mobile-friendly page and given the option to resubscribe.

To customize the view, run:

```sh
rails generate mailkick:views
```

which copies the view into `app/views/mailkick`.

## Sending Emails

Before sending marketing emails, make sure the user has not opted out.

Add the following method to models with email addresses.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  mailkick_user
end
```

Get all users who have opted out

```ruby
User.opted_out
```

And those who have not - send to these people

```ruby
User.not_opted_out
```

Check one user

```ruby
user.opted_out?
```

## Bounces and Spam Reports

Fetch bounces, spam reports, and unsubscribes from your email service.

```ruby
Mailkick.fetch_opt_outs
```

#### Sendgrid

Add the gem

```ruby
gem 'sendgrid_toolkit'
```

Be sure `ENV["SENDGRID_USERNAME"]` and `ENV["SENDGRID_PASSWORD"]` are set.

#### Mandrill

```ruby
gem 'mandrill-api'
```

Be sure `ENV["MANDRILL_APIKEY"]` is set.

#### Mailchimp

```ruby
gem 'gibbon'
```

Be sure `ENV["MAILCHIMP_API_KEY"]` and `ENV["MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID"]` are set.

#### Mailgun

```ruby
gem 'mailgun-ruby'
```

Be sure `ENV["MAILGUN_API_KEY"]` is set.

#### Other

Will gladly accept pull requests.

### Advanced

For more control over services, set them by hand.

```ruby
Mailkick.services = [
  Mailkick::Service::Sendgrid.new(api_key: "API_KEY"),
  Mailkick::Service::Mandrill.new(api_key: "API_KEY")
]
```

## Multiple Lists [beta]

You may want to split your emails into multiple categories, like sale emails and order reminders.

Set the list in the mailer.

```ruby
class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base

  def order_reminder(user)
    headers[:mailkick_list] = "order_reminders"
    # ...
  end

end
```

Pass the `list` option to methods.

```ruby
User.opted_out(list: "order_reminders")
User.not_opted_out(list: "order_reminders")
user.opted_out?(list: "order_reminders")
```

### Opt-In Lists

For opt-in lists, you’ll need to manage the subscribers yourself.

Check opt-ins against the opt-outs

```ruby
User.where(send_me_sales: true).not_opted_out(list: "sales")
```

Check one user

```ruby
user.send_me_sales && !user.opted_out?(list: "sales")
```

## Bonus

More great gems for email

- [Letter Opener](https://github.com/ryanb/letter_opener) - preview email in development

## TODO

- Make it easy to customize controller
- Subscribe to events

## Reference

Change how the user is determined

```ruby
Mailkick.user_method = proc {|email| User.where(email: email).first }
```

Use a different email field

```ruby
mailkick_user email_key: :email_address
```

Unsubscribe

```ruby
user.opt_out
```

Resubscribe

```ruby
user.opt_in
```
